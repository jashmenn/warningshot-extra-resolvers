== warningshot-extra-resolvers

Your own personal WarningShot Resolvers, ripe for sharing.

WarningShot is a fantastic "Dependency Resolution Framework" created by Cory
ODaniel (http://github.com/coryodaniel/warningshot/tree/master). 

This goal of this project is twofold

 1. Provide a collection of Resolvers that may or may not fit into core
 2. Provide an easy-to-use, forkable environment to develop WarningShot Resolvers

== 2008-11-10
Here is a list of initial resolvers I'm planning on creating:
 + check that the current user has an id_rsa, if not, offer to create one (or in config specify to force create one)
 * MySQL database existence
 * find and install Perl libraries with CPAN (sometimes, you're stuck with legacy perl code)
   * note, I have to install custom perl libraries that *dont* resolve with CPAN. they resolve with symlink. support this case as well
 * possibly subversion config?
   at least one that will spit out instructions, tho maybe you can just use the manual providor for all of that.
   though maybe you could just have a FileContent resolver. Specify a file, and a regexp it needs to match, otherwise do something


questionable:
 * adding people to sudoers?

== Patches to warningshot core:
 * erb in the yaml files.
 * search for all resolvers in gems path much like rubigen searches for generators
 * add a 'source' field for gem resolver to support custom gem sources
 * 'order' should be configurable by the item, not only per-resolver

== Questions to ask Cory
 * why does a resolution that passed try to resolve when you run --resolve? My thought is that it shouldn't try unless maybe you passed a force option.

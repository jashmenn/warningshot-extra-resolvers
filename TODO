Here is a list of initial resolvers I'm planning on creating:
 * check that the current user has an id_rsa, if not, offer to create on (or in config specify to force create one)
 * MySQL database existence
 * find and install Perl libraries with CPAN (sometimes, you're stuck with legacy perl code)
   * note, I have to install custom perl libraries that *dont* resolve with CPAN. they resolve with symlink. support this case as well
 * possibly subversion config?
   at least one that will spit out instructions, tho maybe you can just use the manual providor for all of that.
   though maybe you could just have a FileContent resolver. Specify a file, and a regexp it needs to match, otherwise do something

Also maybe patch warningshot to have erb in the yaml files.
